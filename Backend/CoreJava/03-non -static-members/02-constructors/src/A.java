()- constructors; open and closed bracket.
-they come under non-static.
-while creating the object the constructors are going to be executed.
-in every class there will be a default constructor, which is no-arg constructor kept by the compiler itself at the time of compilation.
like this

A()
{
}

-in the no-arg/default constructor, there would be no statements.
