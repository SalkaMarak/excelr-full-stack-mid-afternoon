2. It is one of the object oriented programming language concept.
3. It is one of the basic pillars of object oriented programming language(OOPs).
4. Hiding the internal implementation details which is unneccessary for that class or interface, and just showing the functionality.
5. In case of abstraction also we are acheiving security, because we are not exposing the internal implementation details which is unneccessary implementation for that class or interface.
6. A class can be declared as abstract. 'abstract' is a keyword.
7. If a class is declared abstract then, that class can have any no of abstract methods.
8. We can declare a non-static method as 'abstract'.
9. Abstract methods doesnt contain a body.
10. abstract class can contain both abstract methods and non-abstract methods(concrete, defined: those under curly braces)
11. abstract class can also become a member of the java file.
12. for abstract class also javac compiler generates a '.class' file.
